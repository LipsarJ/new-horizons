"Thanks to God that you came along! You can defend us against those brutes...",
"Ahh, heaven sent you at a most crucial moment: we are about to come under attack. HELP US!",
"Well met, I say, we desperately need a fighting ",
" like you to ward of that raid...",
"Hey, calm down! My, my, you are already stiff from fear... Now tell me what's going on here.",
"Oh, come on, you are able to defend yourself, aren't you? I have important affairs to manage and don't want to be bothered with rustic villagebrawls!",
"Ah, our beloved squire visits his",
". What can I do for you, ",
"Welcome to my... err... YOUR",
", what is your desire?",
"Welcome, ",
". What brings you to to my... err... YOUR",
"Oh, I feel terrible! Fever, swollen limbs, darkening around my injuries... I fear I`ve got gangrene!",
"How is the harvest on my farm? How much have you reaped during the ",
" days since the last payment?",
"Hmm, I wonder if this",
" can be improved.",
"Listen, a lot of scoundrels scoure these islands, raiders that enjoy plunder, torture and rape. Maybe they come here, and in that case you need some last resort. Here, take this grenade...",
"I have no use for this farmhouse anymore. Dismantle it, load the planks into our hold and report to the boatswain for shipduties.",
"Just passing by...",
"Hey, why do stand here so motionless? ",
"Have you swallowed a broomstick...",
"Come on, relax a little... AT EASE!",
"I expect a bit more activity from my marines, ya hear me?",
"Umm, excuse me, I don't want to be petty, but this 'building' looks a bit odd to me...",
"Hey, you there in front of the keyboard! This is a building that YOU created, so how about creating your own dialog as well? Just use Notepad to open the file program\dialogs\ ",
" and overwrite this text with your own. Then follow the instructions in the comments.",
"Overwrite this with the dialogtext of the NPC.",
"Text of the player dialogoption link.l1 which ends the dialog.",
"Text of the player dialogoption link.l2 which leads to another exchange.",
"...and if any scum dares to enter my.. err.. your estate, Squire, I'll blast them to kingdom come.",
"That's the spirit! Great to have such loyal subjects. But be careful who you blow up...",
"Oh, yes, we could dump the",
" we currently have in here if you want to give this",
" a new function. You just have to give us some of your ",
" plankunits, ",
" gold and ",
" sailors. What are you thinking of?",
"Umm, I don'think I should invest even more here.",
"Luxurious furniture (improves chance of successful woundtreatment in houses; 5 planks, 1000 G, 1 Crw).",
"A",
"Right. My clerk will assign the necessary resources to you, and I expect that you finish the work till my next visit. See ya!",
"Umm, ",

" men. But, as I said, we have only ",
" hands...",
"Oops... a small... err... Well, so you'll have to live on in this place as it is...",
"The plantation slaves are rising. And they have already captured some weapons! They have been brutalized so much by years of cruel opression that they'll spare no white man... or woman! Oh, if we had only more of those bastions, stockades, mines and cannon...",
"These landlubbers are all paralysed with fear! Spoiled from landlife. Seems like I'll have to do the fighting without them.",
"A bunch of maurading buccaneers... THERE!",
"We managed to harvest ",
" bushels of wheat and ",
" bales of tobacco. The export of that earns us the money that we urgently need for the goods and tools we can't produce ourselves. Though the local store won't buy tobacco cause the farms here produce it in abundance.",
"Swell, I need wheat to feed my greedy crew.",
"I'll take the cash crop.",
"Why ",
" bushels? How does this add up? Can you enlighten me, please.",
"What? Feed your crew? With our wheat?",
"Hey, don't you get above your station, serf! This is MY farm and therefore MY crop.",
"Oh no! You want to TAKE our tobacco?",
"Sorry, ",
", we have already made other plans for the crop. We managed to harvest ",
" bushels lately, and we have already contacted a merchant who will export it for us. As I said, we urgently need that income to buy the goods and tools we can't produce ourselves.",
"*I* own this farm, so *I* own the crop as well. You indentured workers have no rights but duties only!",
"What do you need money and goods for? And tools? Don't you have hands? After all I provide you with all you need: protection, materials, work...",
"I'll take that... err... take care of that. I bet you would get cheated by your buyer anyway, so it is in your best interest if I arrange the sale for you.",
" Send the whole stuff to my ship.",
"Well done. I'll abate the rent and leave half of the crop to you. Use the profit wisely to increase your fortune. (And mine as well...)",
"So you worked hard, eh? As a reward for that I'll abate the rent and leave you half of the crop for your own account.(In the hope that you'll work even harder...)",
"Listen, I'll leave you half of this so that you can improve your living and working conditions. I want my estate to be a decent and happy place. (And an effective and profitable one...)",
"That much? Umm, I must check if there is enough space in my ship for that. Would be a bit frustrating if the fruits of all your hard labor had to be dumped on the beach for lack of storage, eh?",
"? How does this add up? Can you enlighten me, please.",
"Oh, beggin your pardon, Mylord, but times have been hard for us lately: the yellow fever struck us one after the other and we were unable to work the fields...",
"I'm awfully sorry, Squire, but there is not a single bushel left in our barn: just the other night some plunderers stole all we had stored for you. You really should do more for the security of your estate...",
"I hate to say it, Your Lordship, but we can hardly get by on your estate here: poor soil, bad climate and the recent draught have destroyed the whole harvest...",
"Well, if things are really that hard for you I won't make them even harder: I'll remit your tenure, but only for this time. Cause I can't afford to show weakness too often, I can keep my crew only under control if they respect me as a tough guy.",
"Allright, let's skip THIS payment. But the next time I don't want to hear any excuses again... After all your dues are supposed to support my ship, and the crew will not be pleased if they have to forfeit their bonus.",
"Hmm, there is no point in killing the cow you want to milk, is there? I let you off the hook this time, but I expect that you resume payment as soon as things run better for you. Though my crew will grumble that I'm too soft on you landlubbers.",
"Belay that whining, I have heard those empty excuses too often to believe them any longer. You probably spent your days sleeping on a haystack instead of tending my fields, eh? Well, if you can't pay the tenure by sharecropping You'll have to pay in gold...",
"Lazy bugger, you should have spent less time molesting your sheep! Well, if you can't pay the tenure by sharecropping you'll have to pay in gold...",
"Shut up, you wailing embezzler! You probably sold the stuff on your own account, eh? Not with me, I'll confiscate your money. It's MINE anyway.",
"That's most generous of you, ",
". I'll tell everybody what a kind and caring landlord you are, you can be sure of that!",
"Oh, don't bother, I'm not so keen on my reputation. By the way, I grant you leave tonight. Why don't you go downtown, mingle with the townfolk, chat a lot... Have fun!",
"Allright, you own this estate, so if you wan't to ruin it... But don't complain if you are soon without farmhands cause we've starved...",
"A bit shortsighted to squeeze an estate dry just to increase the short term profit, if you ask me. But I assume you DON'T ask me, eh? Well, you shall have your rack rent, even if you choke from it...",
"You want to skim off the whole result of all our hard labor? Well, YOU tell that my... err... your farmhands. And don't be surprised if some of the harvest will fall into the sea on the way to your ship...",
"Hmm, I wonder if it was a good idea to tarnish my reputation and stifle my farmhands' diligence by taking it all.",
"Well, here, take your rack rent, you capitalist exploiterer. But be sure that the masked avangers of the revolutionary PLO will indict you in front of a people's tribunal for that! Farmers of all islands, unite! Down with the feudalistic yoke!",
"Don't unnerstand yer gob, but if ya pay I no care what ya say.",
"What? The Pirates Liberation Organization still exists? Hasn't our government claimed that the 'liberation' of the barbary states would exterminate them? Well, never believe those liars in the statehouse...",
"AARGH! The Pirates Liberation Organization! An insurgency on my very own estate!",
"Well, if you take my possessions from me I'll take your's from you as well! With one of YOUR grenades! Ironic, isn't it? My life is nothing but a bad farce...",
"You are my ruin! What am I supposed to live on? I'll starve! ... NO! I won't! I'll rather die fast, with a bang and not with a whimper! Where is my powderkeg?",
"You destroyed my life, you vampire! All that's left to me is this keg'o'rum... Beautiful strong rum, burns in your throat like hellfire... Hellfire, that's where you belong... YA HEAR ME, BLOODSUCKER? HELLFIRE YOU SHALL GET! Hehe, this spirit burns not only in the throat...",
"Oh, come on, now you REALLY overdramatise...",
"Hey, what are you up to? Careful, you may cause a fatal accident...",
"Allright, kill yourself if you like. Loosers like you can easily be replaced...",
"Well, here, take your darned money. But don't complain if you are soon without tenants cause we've starved...",
"Then I have no choice but to borrow the money for you from a loanshark. Means that I'll probably end up with a broken arm... in the BEST case...",
"Allright, you leech, here, take this money which I had saved for my sick mother.",
"Hmm, I wonder if it was a good idea to tarnish my reputation by insisting on these ",
" gold.",
"Ah, you're telling me... I have to endure these 'oddities' of my home all day long! The worst thing is that the walls are so cracked that people can walk right through them. No darned privacy, not even in my own bed! It's all the fault of the wretched architect who designed this, Couchcaptain Charles. That code nerd actually knows nothing about housemodels, he only stole some designs from Inez Diaz and placed them at the most impossible sites.",
"Hey, belay that wailing! Isn't it better to have an odd home than no home at all? Would you prefer to sleep on the beach? I for my part will enjoy the sights and features of my new buildings instead of wasting my time with nitpicking.",
"Instead of complaining about others you should get your own ass moving and tackle the problem yourself. What's the exact cause of this? I know something about modelling, maybe I can help?",
"Never mind the looks, what I don't like is the economic part: the amount of taxes and profits. And the frequency of attacks and events, the punishments...",
"Any help would be most appreciated. Some of these buildingmodels could certainly do with a remodeling. The main problem is that these buildingmodels are not part of the locationmodel but items attached to stationary characters, like me. Therefore the walkpatch of the locationmodel -which prevents characters from walking through walls- doesn't cover these new buildings. What we need is a walkpatch around the buildingitems. Or around the characters to which the buildingitems are attached. If you know a solution for this post it at the PotC modding forum at ",
"Ummm, I'll think about that...",
"No need to gripe about that. You can tweak that yourself just by editing a textfile. For example here is how you can half my payments to you (hehe): Open the file 'pirates of the caribbean\program\dialogs\ ",
" ' with a texteditor like notepad. Use the search function to search for the catchword 'reward'. This will lead you to one or several lines similar to this: ' npchar.tax = taxdays * 10;	// Reward rentmoney... '. Replace the '10' with '5' to half my payments. (Don't expect me to tell you how to RAISE them ;) ). Likewise you can tweak other things by searching for the catchwords 'chance' for eventchances, or 'punishment' for e.g. reputationlosses. The comment behind the '//' doubleslashes will tell you what the code before does. To disable the influence of reputation on revenue find the two lines with the comment '// reputationinfluence..' and delete them. If you need more info post at the PotC modding forum at ",
"Hey, thanks for the hints. Sounds like modding is not that difficult, eh? Just requires some patience and dedication. But if I am able to manage playing this game I should also be able to tweak it a bit.",
"Allright, here is a little lesson on the socioeconomics of your estate: Every day your workers and tenants work on your estate, save their earnings or stockpile goods. How much they save and store depends very much on your behaviour: content people work more efficient, confident people save and store for the future and if you treat your people decently and show that you can protect them they more willing to yield money or goods to you. Otherwise they go slack, embezzle what should be yours or even revolt. A good measure is your reputiation: the higher your reputation the higher your revenue. And vice versa: the better your behaviour on your estate the higher your reputation. So you must learn to balance your immediate need for money and goods with the long term prosperity of your estate. Be strict when you must and generous when you can.",
"And you call that socioeconomics? Sounds more like voodoo economics to me. Or couch economics rather. What do you need savings for? After all I provide you with all you need: protection, housing, food, work.. So it's only fair that all your gold wanders in my.. err.. the communal coffers. That's what I call socioeconomics, learned that from a really clever guy called Marx!",
"I see... Listen, I'll leave you half of your savings so that you can improve your living and working conditions. I want my estate to be a decent and happy place. (And an effective and profitable one...)",
"I don't like this. I'd sacrifice this taxpayment for information on how to tweak this mod to my liking. All these events and influences just don't suit my playstyle.",
"Aww, I am so awed by your presence that I don't dare to move.",
"Man, I've been working all day long, all my bones are aching, and I won't let you keep me from having a well earned rest.",
"Would you believe it, I have to support the whole building. It will collapse if I move as much as my little finger...",
"Psaw, allright, I understand... Goodbye.",
"I'm wounded. Can you help me?",
"I'd love to chat a bit...",
"I'm in a talking mood. Do you have time for a chat?",
"I have some time to spare and would like to spend it in amiable company.",
"Oh, is it already that late? I've got to go, goodbye.",
"You are a welcome guest, and I'd love to hear a sailor's stories...",
"And I would like to hear about the latest scandals of the town...",
"Fascinating! Please do go on...",
"Most interesting! Tell me more...",
"Oh, how terrible! I'll clean and dress your wounds, and then you will stay in bed till tomorrow. You need a rest, believe me.",
"Thanks, you are too kind. Damn, am I tired, I think I'll sleep right away...",
"I don`t think I can wait that long. Thank's, but I must leave.",
"Calm down, I still have my late mothers medicinechest. Here, look at all those bottles: something will surely cure you, but I have no idea what all those outlandish names mean. You must decide what I shall put on your gangrenous wounds!",
"Fortunately have I recently bought a medicinechest. Was a real bargain, it once belonged to a Spanish surgeon who died of... eh, ehem... gangrene. But nevermind that, there is such an impressive array of bottles with scientific names, one will surely be suitable for woundtreatment. But which one?",
"Well, last year I bought a medicinechest but never used it. Forgot that I cant read... But you will surely be able to choose the right remedy. Here, have a look at the labels...",
"Take the ethanol.",
"Use the isopropyl.",
"vinegar it is.",
"Lets try mercury.",
"Hamamelis Virginia sounds good.",
"Try Cera Alba.",
"Use the potassium.",
"chamberlye it is.",
"How about sodium.",
"Damn your junkpile of quack remedies ! Before I die Ill rather try my own medical mixture!",
"Good idea! Lie down now and let me take care of your injuries, and in the morning you will be fit to slaughter skeletonpirates by the dozen again.",
"Skeletonpirates? Bah, are you trying to lull me with fairy tales? Dont bother, Im already asleep...",
"I hope I do not wake up as skeletonpirate myself...",
"I hope you know what you are doing...",
