", suspicious movements at our perimeter, man battlestations!",
"A detailed report, Marine, NOW.",
"Leave me alone with that, that's YOUR job! After all that's what I hired you for: as cannonfodd... er... cannonfeeder. I have no time anyway: must hurry back to my safe white house, don my bomberjacket and deliver some toughsounding quips to the electorate...",
"Report",
" manned and ready for battle, ",
" all quiet in this sector.",
"We withdraw from this position. Tear down this",
", load the planks into our hold and report to the Sergeant of my Marines for shipduties.",
"I need a safe place to store some of my treasure and equipment, and this olde keep looks like a VERY safe place. Can you keep some stuff for me here?",
"I'd like to have a word about my possessions with that Ole Creeper fellow.",
"I wonder if it makes sense to position a gun here.",
"Marine, I have a special task for you: Here, take this grenade, and if the enemy should break trough and storm this position...",
"Just passing by...",
"Very good, Marine, carry on.",
"Hey, why do stand here so motionless? ",
"Have you swallowed a broomstick...",
"Come on, relax a little... AT EASE!",
"I expect a bit more activity from my marines, ya hear me?",
"Hey, you there in front of the keyboard! This is a building that YOU created, so how about creating your own dialog as well? Just use Notepad to open the file program\dialogs\ ",

"...I'll blast them to kingdom come. I know my duty, Commander!",
"That's the spirit, Marine! With your sense of duty you'll soon become corporal. (...if you live that long...)",
"Absolutely, ",
"! A cannon down here covering the entrance could blast any intruder to kingdom come.",
"Maybe, but I don't want to spend even more money here.",
"Here are 5000 Gold, can you... err... obtain a proper gun with that?",
"Yes, ",
", I know the mastersergeant of the local magazine quite well. For 5000 Gold he'd sell his whole ordinance. Just give me a few hours.",
"That's the spirit, Marine! With your understanding of logistics you'll soon become corporal. (...if you live that long...)",
"Ah, speaking of valuables, that reminds me that I found a piece of jewelry in the old catacombs below this keep. I was pis... err... patroling down there when I noticed a fresh crevice in one of the walls. Behind that I found an old burial chamber, and amongst some old bones there was this little gem blinking at me, as if inviting me to take it. But on second thought I realized that ",
"By the way, I have an addition to your possessions: this piece of jewelry. Found it yesterday when clearing away some debris from a recently collapsed wall. Among the stones there was a broken urn, ashes, bonesplinters, teeth... AND this beautiful gem. Of course ",
"Before you deal with your inventory you can add this piece of jewelry to it. Yesterday I was clearing the burialchamber in the keep's former chapel -to make room there for ru... err... ammunition storage- when this shining object fell out of a heap of bones I was carrying. Right into my lap, like a gift from heaven. Or Hades rather. By rights ",
"it belongs to you as you are now the owner of this estate. So I'd rather hand it over to you lest the curse of it's dead owner falls on me.",
"(Curse of it's dead owner? Yikes!) Oh no, keep it for yourself. After all you deserve a reward for your honesty and loyalty, Marine! With your sense of honesty you'll soon become corporal. (...if you live that long...)",
"Curse? Superstitious rubbish! You want to scare me into leaving you that gem, eh? Not with me, hand it over to your commander. NOW!",
"Aye, ",
", I'll call the Keeper of this Donjon. By the way, his ways are a bit a bit oldfash... err... traditional, has been living in this ancient Tower too long, if you ask me. But exactly that traditional attitude makes him a most reliable Keeper for your treasure. You can give him anything for safekeeping and be sure that he will give it back to you whenever you want it.",
"I hope so. Now where is that medievil factotum?",
", your wish is my command. By the way, what about a little... err... reward? Wouldn't it be good for your troops' morale if honest loyal soldiers were rewarded?",
"Insolent bastard! Veiled demands? How dare you! Enough of that, I want to deal with my treasues. NOW!",
"That's most generous of you, ",
". I'll tell everybody what a kind and caring commander you are, you can be sure of that!",
"Oh, don't bother, I'm not so keen on my reputation. By the way, I grant you leave tonight. Why don't you go downtown, mingle with the townfolk, chat a lot... And now back to MY treasure, if you please.",
"Savage Akellani cannibals approaching, ",
"! Oh, if we had only more of those bastions, stockades, mines and cannon...",
" Attention, soldier! Hold this position whatever happens. Keep up firing, don't let the enemy draw you into close combat. I will take care of the bladework...",
"Francisco Pizarro the Younger and his horde of maurading conquistadores approaching, ",
"! Lusting for blood, plunder and rape... Oh, if we had only more of those bastions, stockades, mines and cannon...",
"Well, true, the design of this tower is antiquated. The Pentagonal Keep was invented during Norman times, when scaling and simple siege machines were the main threat for a fortification. The massive vaults were designed to withstand battering rams and undermining, so the lower storeys here are almost completely filled with masonry and offer no space for accomodation. The invention of gunpowder has made this architecture obsolete. Nowadays these towers are often used as prison or for storing valuables, cause that's what they were designed for in the first place: keeping people from getting in. Or out.",
"Ummm, in that regard it's a very successful design: I find it very difficult to get in or out without smashing into some wall.",
"We always stand to attention in a superior's presence. That's the drill, and the drill is everything.",
"I have my eye on a suspicious target, and I don't want too loose it. 'Keep your aim, never flinch, never blink' our drillseargeant used to say.",
"First rule of camouflage: movement attracts attention. So never move if you don't have to.",
"Allright, I understand... Carry on.",
