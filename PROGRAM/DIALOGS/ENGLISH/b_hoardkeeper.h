"Now, young ",
", whose rash voice resonates in these so venerable vaults, state your desire with the manners of a noble ",
", or let silence rule o'er ancient walls once more. Walls, once hung with tapestries of silk and velvet, once seeing regal feasts and regal battles.. and regal treachery and murder! Now silence is this ruin's royalty, these cold stone's only veil, for cent'ries past, and cent'ries come. Silence of peace? Silence of death? Which it shall be for you is not yet written in the scriptures.",
"Huh? Wha.. I didn't hear any door... Where do you come from so suddenly and stealthy?",
"So you are supposed to be the famous guardian of treasures? How can I be sure that you don't embezzle my stuff, eh?",
"(Darned, where is my 'Shakespeare for Elemantary School'? Ah, here..) Ehem.. Here I stand, humbled in the face of age and wisdom, wishing to entrust you, treasured trustee, my humble trove, though knowing it amounts to nought before these eyes and stones which witnessed so much greater treasure. And so much greater men!",
"Oh, please, can't we just get down to the safekeeping business?",
"Who else but me, haunting these ancient walls so long as to resemble mortar holding stone and stone together, brittle, yes, but still standing upright and proud, who else should better know the hidden ways that men now long forgotten build here once, a vain attempt to hide their wicked ways. Vain as all their wickedness, alas, did nothing to avert their fatal fate. Their fate, will it be yours as well? Who knows that now? Who'll know when hit it will? Who will know, once it has hit, of you? No one, nevermore!",
"Oh so right you are, o Olde Keeper, out of dust we become only to become dust once again! But what we in between achieve is what makes us men or mice. To be rich and famous, or not to be at all, THAT is the question.",
"Don't you, knave, question my blood's hounour! My house served kings and counts and barons for cent'ries without fail. One of my blood kept Lionheart's ransom, and not a copper spent but for his liege lords freedom. One of my blood, Londinum's royal Tower's keeper when the Third Richard kept in chains his very brother's sons, could not condone the cruel crime his oath of office forced him to partake in. But rather than betray his master, depraved as he might be, he chose to end his life in honour. But not before performing the sad act sealing the poor princelings' fate. A heinous act, for sure, and hurting my forefather's soul as much as his poor victims' bodies. But always did he hold his duty higher than his welfare, than his salvation even, yes! And so will I, as long as I can breathe!",
"So save your breathe then, most faithful Keeper, as to be so much the longer able to perform your burd'ning duty. As for the knavish kings and barons, the plague on all their houses!",
"How dare you, yokel! Don't you mock The Bard, mimicking words of beauty with stumbling a tongue, sooting the sooth of his venerable verse with vain wit! Here, hear his true text, truant, and may his very words win you a hundred cents of wisdom! (Keeper recites Hamlet... for two hours) But halt, enough of idle words, time is out of joint already! Now will I open the Domesday Book of what your wicked designs and vainglorious schemes won you?",
"Err... yes, PLEASE! All's well that ends well, eh?",
