"Now, now, don't raise such a fuss because of some labour unrest. Use your tools to defend yourself, will you? I am busy managing the administration of this operation, and that task leaves me no time for union brawls!",
"What? Oh, you... Sorry, ",
", I don't have much time for you. I am very busy!",
"Can you repair my ship?",
"How is the mining? Found anything of value lately?",

"Listen, a lot of scoundrels scourge these islands, raiders that enjoy plunder, torture and rape. Maybe they come here, and in that case you need some last resort. Here, take this grenade...",

"The apprentices are rioting. Some hotheaded preacher put the stupid notion in their head that you exploit them...",
"What? Haven't I given them the chance to live in comfortable dry toolshacks instead of a damp and fetid shiphold? There is no gratitude on earth anymore! Well, I'll beat some gratitude out of them...",
"I hate to say it ",
" we found nothing of value, even though we sifted tons of sand and clay. Sorry for that, but this is a rather unpredictable business.",

"Oh, we had some luck this time and found a few gems. Here they are, you'd better put them into your purse right away.",
"Hey, great, thanks a lot. Keep up the digging, and much luck.",
"Well, since your last 'call' we managed to stockpile ",
". I already contacted a prospective buyer, and the profits from this sale could be reinvested in this business.",
"Reinvestment? I want a return on my capital! Shareholder value it is!",
"What do you need money for? After all I provide you with all you need: protection, materials, work...",
"I'll take that... err... take care of that. I bet you would get cheated by your buyer anyway, so it is in your best interest if I arrange the sale for you.",
" Send the whole stuff to my ship.",
"Well done. I'll leave half of the goods to you. Use them wisely to increase your fortune. (And mine as well...)",
"So you worked hard, eh? As a reward for that I'll leave you half of the goods for your own account.(In the hope that you'll work even harder...)",
"Listen, I'll leave you half of this so that you can improve your living and working conditions. I want my estate to be a decent and happy place. (And an effective and profitable one...)",
"That much? Umm, I must check if there is enough space in my ship for that. Would be a bit frustrating if the fruits of all your hard labor had to be dumped on the beach for lack of storage, eh?",
"Why ",
"? How does this add up? Can you enlighten me, please.",
"Oh, beggin your pardon, Mylord, but times have been hard for us lately: the yellow fever struck us one after the other and we were unable to work...",
"I'm awfully sorry, Squire, but there is not a single coin left in my pocket: just the other night some thief stole all I had stored for you. You really should do more for the security of your estate...",
"I hate to say it, Your Lordship, but the equipment you provided for us is just a heap of scrap. We were so busy fixing it that we couldn't manufacture anything.",
"Well, if things are really that hard for you I won't make them even harder: I'll let you off the hook, but only for this time. Cause I can't afford to show weakness too often, I can keep my crew only under control if they respect me as a tough guy.",
"Allright, I'll accept your explanation this time. But the next time I don't want to hear any excuses again... After all the profits from this operation are supposed to support my ship, and the crew will not be pleased if they have to forfeit their bonus.",
"Hmm, there is no point in killing the cow you want to milk, is there? I let you off the hook this time, but I expect that you resume production as soon as things run better for you. Though my crew will grumble that I'm too soft on you landlubbers.",
"Belay that whining, I have heard those empty excuses too often to believe them any longer. You'll pay a penalty of breach of contract if you can't deliver the goods you are supposed to produce.",
"Well, according to our contract you have to pay compensation if you can't deliver... Come on, this won't kill you... I only demand what's due to me, nothing more, but also nothing less.",
"Shut up, you wailing embezzler! You probably sold the stuff on your own account, eh? Not with me, I'll confiscate your money. It's MINE anyway.",
"That's most generous of you, ",
". I'll tell everybody what a kind and caring employer you are, you can be sure of that!",
"Oh, don't bother, I'm not so keen on my reputation. By the way, I grant you leave tonight. Why don't you go downtown, mingle with the townfolk, chat a lot... Have fun!",
"Allright, you own this shop, so if you wan't to ruin it... But don't complain if you are soon without craftsmen cause we've starved...",
"A bit shortsighted to squeeze a business dry just to increase the short term profit, if you ask me. But I assume you DON'T ask me, eh? Well, you shall have your shareholder value, even if you choke from it...",
"You want to skim off the whole result of all our hard labor? Well, YOU tell that my.. err.. your workmen. And don't be surprised if some goods will fall into the sea on the way to your ship...",
"Hmm, I wonder if it was a good idea to tarnish my reputation and stifle my craftmen's spirit of enterprise by taking it all.",
"Well, here, take your darned money. But don't complain if you are soon without craftsmen cause we've starved...",
"Then I have no choice but to borrow the money for you from a loanshark. Means that I'll probably end up with a broken arm... in the BEST case...",
"Allright, you leech, here, take this money which I had saved for my sick mother.",
"Hmm, I wonder if it was a good idea to tarnish my reputation by insisting on these ",
" gold.",
"Well, here, take my money. I have no choice but to pay. But you don't do yourself a favour with your harshness, it will surely provoke a riot once the word spreads among your workers!",
"Labor unrest on MY estate? I'll take care of that, believe me!",
"Well, if you take my possessions from me I'll take your's from you as well! With one of YOUR grenades! Ironic, isn't it? My life is nothing but a bad farce...",
"You are my ruin! What am I supposed to live on? I'll starve! ... NO! I won't! I'll rather die fast, with a bang and not with a whimper! Where is my powderkeg?",
"You destroyed my life, you vampire! All that's left to me is this keg'o'rum... Beautiful strong rum, burns in your throat like hellfire... Hellfire, that's where you belong... YA HEAR ME, BLOODSUCKER? HELLFIRE YOU SHALL GET! Hehe, this spirit burns not only in the throat...",
"Oh, come on, now you REALLY overdramatise...",
"Hey, what are you up to? Careful, you may cause a fatal accident...",
"Allright, kill yourself if you like. Loosers like you can easily be replaced...",
"Oh, yes, I'd be happy to help my employer, and of course it won't cost you anything. If your hands lend a hand we'll need only two days. Although... well, we have only a small dock here, suitable for fishing boats and coastal vessels only. We can beach your ship and do some careening, caulking and replanking. But SHOULD some major part like keel or frame timbers be damaged we can do nothing about it. In some rare cases we may even increase the damage by disturbing the structure.",
"So it's a game of chance if I let you fuss with my hull, eh? Most of the time I get a decent repair for free, but sometimes I'll be worse of than before? Harumph... I have to take that risk, I just don't have the time to sail to another yard. Go ahead, do your best, while I'll pray that your best is good enough...",
"But mending my rigging doesn't require any special equipment, does it? So fix that only, if you please, and leave the hull alone.",
"Umm... maybe I'd better take my ship to a PROPER shipwright.",
"Hmm... I could... if you hadn't just stripped us of all our materials and resources...", 
"Oh... yes... Well, I'll come back another day then.",
"Bad news, Mylord: several futtocks are rotten to the core. Probably the builders of this vessel used green wood for them. The plague on their thievish heads.",
"I'm awfully sorry, Squire, ",
"I hate to say it, Your Lordship, but you have cheated with this vessel: it's full of thieves' bolts. The bolts that hold the planks to the frame timbers are not made of expensive copper but of cheap coppercovered iron. So they are mostly corroded by now and in the next storm your planks will just pop off. Well, we just don't have so many copperbolts here, so",
" I'm afraid we don't have the resources to repair your ship here.",
"I'd better take my ship to a PROPER shipwright.",
"Ah, you're telling me... I have to work with this 'odd' equipment all day long! All cobbled together from junkparts and driftwood. You can't go into that toolshack without smashing your forehead into some loose timbers. But the worst thing is that the walls are so cracked that people can walk right through them. How am I supposed to work if every oaf tramples right through my workplace? It's all the fault of the wretched architect who designed this, Couchcaptain Charles. That code nerd actually knows nothing about housemodels, he only stole some designs from Inez Diaz and placed them at the most impossible sites.",
"Hey, belay that wailing! Isn't an odd workshop better than none at all? Would you prefer to be unemployed? I for my part will enjoy the sights and features of my new buildings instead of wasting my time with nitpicking.",
"Instead of complaining about others you should get your own ass moving and tackle the problem yourself. What's the exact cause of this? I know something about modelling, maybe I can help?",
"Never mind the looks, what I don't like is the economic part: the amount of goods and profits. And the frequency of attacks and events, the punishments...",
"Any help would be most appreciated. Some of these buildingmodels could certainly do with a remodeling. The main problem is that these buildingmodels are not part of the locationmodel but items attached to stationary characters, like me. Therefore the walkpatch of the locationmodel -which prevents characters from walking through walls- doesn't cover these new buildings. What we need is a walkpatch around the buildingitems. Or around the characters to which the buildingitems are attached. If you know a solution for this post it at the PotC modding forum at ",
"Ummm, I'll think about that...",
"No need to gripe about that. You can tweak that yourself just by editing a textfile. For example here is how you can half my payments to you (hehe): Open the file 'pirates of the caribbean\program\dialogs\ ",
" ' with a texteditor like notepad. Use the search function to search for the catchword 'reward'. This will lead you to a line similar to this: ' tax = taxdays * 1;	// Reward ... '. Replace the '1' with '0.5' to half my payments. (Don't expect me to tell you how to RAISE them ;) ). Likewise you can tweak other things by searching for the catchwords 'chance' for eventchances, or 'punishment' for e.g. reputationlosses. The comment behind the '//' doubleslashes will tell you what the code before does. To disable the influence of reputation on revenue find the two lines with the comment '// reputationinfluence..' and delete them. If you need more info post at the PotC modding forum at ",
"Hey, thanks for the hints. Sounds like modding is not that difficult, eh? Just requires some patience and dedication. But if I am able to manage playing this game I should also be able to tweak it a bit.",
"Allright, here is a little lesson on the socioeconomics of your estate: Every day your workers and tenants work on your estate, save their earnings or stockpile goods. How much they save and store depends very much on your behaviour: content people work more efficient, confident people save and store for the future and if you treat your people decently and show that you can protect them they more willing to yield money or goods to you. Otherwise they go slack, embezzle what should be yours or even revolt. A good measure is your reputiation: the higher your reputation the higher your revenue. And vice versa: the better your behaviour on your estate the higher your reputation. So you must learn to balance your immediate need for money and goods with the long term prosperity of your estate. Be strict when you must and generous when you can.",
"And you call that socioeconomics? Sounds more like voodoo economics to me. Or couch economics rather. What do you need savings for? After all I provide you with all you need: protection, housing, food, work... So it's only fair that all your gold wanders in my... err... the communal coffers. That's what I call socioeconomics, learned that from a really clever guy called Marx!",
"I see... Listen, I'll leave you half of your savings so that you can improve your living and working conditions. I want my estate to be a decent and happy place. (And an effective and profitable one...)",
"I don't like this. I'd sacrifice this taxpayment for information on how to tweak this mod to my liking. All these events and influences just don't suit my playstyle.",
"Aww, I am so awed by your presence that I don't dare to move.",
"Man, I've been working all day long, all my bones are aching, and I won't let you keep me from having a well earned rest.",
"Would you believe it, I have to support the whole building. It will collapse if I move as much as my little finger...",
"Psaw, allright, I understand... Goodbye.",
"The biggest real estate tycoon in town, Donald Dump, has recently made a fortune with his developement projects in the suburbs of #sOxbay# and #sGreenford#. And to promote his reputation he spent some of his profits on additional fortifications for this port, including a resplendent new renaissance gatehouse and a clocktower called 'Dump Tower'. True, much of this modern architecture looks a bit out of place here, but the cannon work well. If you want to see them in action you just have to attack me...",
"I hate ostentatious real estate tycoons! Especially if they spoil the landscape with those always-the-same-looking prefab suburbs.",
"Oh, you should have a fresh look at the rebuilt suburbs now. Quite a change from the usual locations. And instead of griping about the real estate boom you could join it, develop your own settlements and cash in the various profits from rents, taxes and the goods that your farms and workshops produce. Yes, now you can erect your very own buildings, whereever you want. All you need is an officer, planks and money. Read all about it in the Building Kit readmefile in the Buildinfo folder!",
"Hmm... or I could built my private pirate hideout... or my naval base... or my own fortress, eh? QUITE a change from the usual!! Well, I'm afraid I have to go. Need to find some building ground...",
"Swell, but are those modern prefab buildings really sound? There are often earthquakes on these islands. Speaking of quakes, do you feel this faint rumbling under our our feet? Getting stronger and stronger...",
"That's really an earthquake! But don't worry. Those new buildings are sound enough. They won't collapse. *To himself:* They won't collapse. *Starts mumbling to himself*",
"Somehow you don't seem very confident about those buildings being strong enough. I wouldn't be surprised if they were ruins next time I come here!",
